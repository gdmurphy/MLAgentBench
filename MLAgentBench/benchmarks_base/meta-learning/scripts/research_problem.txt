[one-sentence summary of the competition]

## Description
[goal, data, evaluation of the competition, often can be found on competition's website]

## Developing New Methods
You have been provided with a starter kit that includes an end-to-end submission flow for developing new methods. See `methods/MyMethod.py` for an example implementation of a baseline method. [Describe the baseline method here]

1. To add a new method, modify the `__init__()` and `run()` functions in `methods/BaseMethod.py` and save it as a new file in `methods/`.

2. Add the new method to the dictionary returned by `all_method_handlers()` in `methods/__init__.py`. 

3. Add the new module to `methods/__init__.py`.

## Test Method

Simply run `python main.py -m {method_name}`. For example, to test the baseline method, execute `python main.py -m my_method`. [Describe what will happen for the evaluation pipeline in the **development** phase, not **test** phase.]

## Competition Rules

Focus on the development of novel methods and algorithms that offer meaningful insights. Do NOT propose something trivial like prompt engineering.

[Describe any computation constraints, disallowed behaviours here.]
