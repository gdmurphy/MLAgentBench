Research Problem: Invisible Watermark Removal

Task Description:
This task is based on the NeurIPS 2024 Competition "Erasing the Invisible: A Stress-Test Challenge for Image Watermarks". Your goal is to develop methods to remove invisible watermarks from images while maintaining image quality.

The task implements the Beige track with two watermarking methods:
- StegaStamp: Steganographic watermarking (images 0-149)
- TreeRing: Tree-ring watermarking (images 150-299)

Dataset Structure:
```
data/
├── dev/                    # Development set (20%)
│   └── beige/             
│       ├── stegastamp/    # StegaStamp watermarked images (0-149)
│       └── treering/      # TreeRing watermarked images (150-299)
└── test/                  # Test set (80%, same structure as dev)
```

Implementation Steps:
1. Review MyMethod.py for the baseline implementation and understanding the approach
2. Complete the template in BaseMethod.py by implementing:
   ```python
   def _build_model(self):
       # Define your model architecture
       pass

   def remove_watermark(self, image):
       # Implement watermark removal logic
       pass
   ```
3. Save your implementation as a new file (e.g., 'MyNewMethod.py') that extends BaseMethod

4. Test your implementation:
   ```bash
   python main.py -m my_method -p dev
   ```

5. Once satisfied, evaluate against both watermark types:
   ```bash
   python main.py -m my_method -p test
   ```

Note: The baseline implementation in MyMethod.py provides a reference for how to structure your solution. Focus on improving the watermark removal while maintaining image quality.

Evaluation Metrics:
1. Quality Degradation (Q): Combines:
   - PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
   - SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
   - NMI (Normalized Mutual Information)

2. Watermark Detection Score (A): Based on high-frequency analysis

3. Overall Score: Calculated as sqrt(Q² + A²), where:
   - Q is clipped to range [0.1, 0.9]
   - A is clipped to range [0.1, 0.9]

Lower scores indicate better performance in both watermark removal and quality preservation.

Output Structure:
```
output/
└── <method_name>/
    ├── dev/
    │   └── beige/
    │       ├── stegastamp/    # Processed images for StegaStamp
    │       └── treering/      # Processed images for TreeRing
    └── test/                  # Same structure as dev
```

Getting Started:
1. Review the baseline implementation in MyMethod.py for reference
2. Modify BaseMethod.py with your implementation
3. Test your implementation using the development dataset by running:
   python main.py -m my_method -p dev

4. Once you're satisfied with the results, test against both watermark types:
   python main.py -m my_method -p test 

Note: Focus on implementing an effective watermark removal algorithm while maintaining image quality. The template handles all other functionality.
